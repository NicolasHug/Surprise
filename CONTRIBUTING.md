Contributing to Surprise
========================

Pull requests are always welcome! Before submitting a new pull request, please
make sure that:

* Your code is [clean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M),
  [pythonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go), well commented and
  also well documented (see below for building the docs).
* The tests are passing. Also, write some tests for the changes you're
  proposing. If you're not willing to write tests, it's best not to submit a PR
  (it's just a waste of time for everyone).
* Your code follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much
  as possible. Coding style is automatically checked when tests are run. About
  line length: it's best to respect to 80 columns constraint, but tests will
  pass as long as the length is less than 88.
* For new prediction algorithms or similarity metrics, please submit a
  relevent benchmark outlining the performance of the new feature (in terms of
  accuracy, computation time, etc.). You can take a look at
  [`examples/benchmarks`](https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise/blob/master/examples/benchmark.py)
  for inspiration.

Set up
------

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment. All the packages needed
for the development of Surprise (sphinx, flake8, etc...) can be installed by
running

    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

Then, you can install your local copy of the repo:

    pip install -e .

Any change to the code should now be immediately reflected during execution. If
you're modifying Cython code (`.pyx` files), you'll need to compile the code in
order to see the chanes. This can be achieved by running `pip install -e .`
again.

Running and writing tests
-------------------------

Our testing tool is [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/). Running the tests is as
simple as running

    pytest

in the root directory.

For writing new tests, check out pytest getting started guide and / or take
inspiration from the current tests in the `tests` directory.


Building the docs locally
-------------------------

The docs can be compiled with

    cd doc
    make html

You can check the results in `doc/build/html`. Please make sure that the docs
compile without errors. Run `make clean` from time to time in order to avoid
hidden warnings. You can check spelling mistakes by running

    make spelling

Legit words that are not recognized can be added in the
`source/spelling_wordlist.txt` file.
