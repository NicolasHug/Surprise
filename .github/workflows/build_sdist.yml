# This workflow builds the sdist on 3.8 and then installs that same sdist on
# clean envs from all python versions, then runs tests.
# We also try to replace numpy with oldest-supported-numpy as install-time
# dependency (install-time == installing from the sdist with the .c files
# present). I'm not sure this is the intended use for the package, but this is
# the only way I can find to test on an "old" version of numpy, instead of the
# latest available like the regular `numpy>=X` constraint would do.
