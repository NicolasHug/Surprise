"""
The :mod:`dataset <surprise.dataset>` module defines the :class:`Dataset` class
and other subclasses which are used for managing datasets.

Users may use both *built-in* and user-defined datasets (see the
:ref:`getting_started` page for examples). Right now, three built-in datasets
are available:

* The `movielens-100k <http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>`_ dataset.
* The `movielens-1m <http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>`_ dataset.
* The `Jester <http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/>`_ dataset 2.

Built-in datasets can all be loaded (or downloaded if you haven't already)
using the :meth:`Dataset.load_builtin` method.
