    Run a cross validation procedure for a given algorithm, reporting accuracy
    measures and computation times.

    See an example in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validate_example>`.

    Args:
        algo(:obj:`AlgoBase \
            <surprise.prediction_algorithms.algo_base.AlgoBase>`):
            The algorithm to evaluate.
        data(:obj:`Dataset <surprise.dataset.Dataset>`): The dataset on which
            to evaluate the algorithm.
        measures(list of string): The performance measures to compute. Allowed
            names are function names as defined in the :mod:`accuracy
            <surprise.accuracy>` module. Default is ``['rmse', 'mae']``.
        cv(cross-validation iterator, int or ``None``): Determines how the
            ``data`` parameter will be split (i.e. how trainsets and testsets
            will be defined). If an int is passed, :class:`KFold
            <surprise.model_selection.split.KFold>` is used with the
            appropriate ``n_splits`` parameter. If ``None``, :class:`KFold
            <surprise.model_selection.split.KFold>` is used with
            ``n_splits=5``.
        return_train_measures(bool): Whether to compute performance measures on
            the trainsets. Default is ``False``.
        n_jobs(int): The maximum number of folds evaluated in parallel.

            - If ``-1``, all CPUs are used.
            - If ``1`` is given, no parallel computing code is used at all,\
                which is useful for debugging.
            - For ``n_jobs`` below ``-1``, ``(n_cpus + n_jobs + 1)`` are\
                used.  For example, with ``n_jobs = -2`` all CPUs but one are\
                used.

            Default is ``1``.
        pre_dispatch(int or string): Controls the number of jobs that get
            dispatched during parallel execution. Reducing this number can be
            useful to avoid an explosion of memory consumption when more jobs
            get dispatched than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - ``None``, in which case all the jobs are immediately created\
                and spawned. Use this for lightweight and fast-running\
                jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand spawning of the\
                jobs.
            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are\
                spawned.
            - A string, giving an expression as a function of ``n_jobs``,\
                as in ``'2*n_jobs'``.

            Default is ``'2*n_jobs'``.
        verbose(int): If ``True`` accuracy measures for each split are printed,
            as well as train and test times. Averages and standard deviations
            over all splits are also reported. Default is ``False``: nothing is
            printed.

    Returns:
        dict: A dict with the following keys:

            - ``'test_*'`` where ``*`` corresponds to a lower-case accuracy
              measure, e.g. ``'test_rmse'``: numpy array with accuracy values
              for each testset.

            - ``'train_*'`` where ``*`` corresponds to a lower-case accuracy
              measure, e.g. ``'train_rmse'``: numpy array with accuracy values
              for each trainset. Only available if ``return_train_measures`` is
              ``True``.

            - ``'fit_time'``: numpy array with the training time in seconds for
              each split.

            - ``'test_time'``: numpy array with the testing time in seconds for
              each split.
