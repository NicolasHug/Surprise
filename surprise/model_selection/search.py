            <surprise.accuracy>` module.  Default is ``['rmse', 'mae']``.
        cv(cross-validation iterator, int or ``None``): Determines how the
            ``data`` parameter will be split (i.e. how trainsets and testsets
            will be defined). If an int is passed, :class:`KFold
            <surprise.model_selection.split.KFold>` is used with the

            useful to avoid an explosion of memory consumption when more jobs
            get dispatched than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

        best_score (dict of floats):
            Using an accuracy measure as key, get the best average score
            achieved for that measure.

            Using an accuracy measure as key, get the parameters combination
            that gave the best accuracy results for the chosen measure (on
            average).

        """Samples ``n_iter`` parameter combinations from
        ``param_distributions`` using ``random_state`` as a seed.

        Non-deterministic iterable over random candidate combinations for
        hyper-parameter search. If all parameters are presented as a list,
        sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter
        is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used.
        It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous
        parameters.

        Note that before SciPy 0.16, the ``scipy.stats.distributions`` do not
        accept a custom RNG instance and always use the singleton RNG from
        ``numpy.random``. Hence setting ``random_state`` will not guarantee a
        deterministic iteration whenever ``scipy.stats`` distributions are used
        to define the parameter search space. Deterministic behavior is however
        guaranteed from SciPy 0.16 onwards.

        Args:
            param_distributions(dict): Dictionary where the keys are
                parameters and values are distributions from which a parameter
                is to be sampled. Distributions either have to provide a
                ``rvs`` function to sample from them, or can be given as a list
                 of values, where a uniform distribution is assumed.
            n_iter(int): Number of parameter settings produced.
                Default is ``10``.
            random_state(int, RandomState instance or None):
                Pseudo random number generator seed used for random uniform
                sampling from lists of possible values instead of scipy.stats
                distributions. If ``None``, the random number generator is the
                random state instance used by np.random.  Default is ``None``.

            combos(list): List of parameter dictionaries with sampled values.
