"""
This module contains tests to make sure that rating scales like that of Jester
(i.e. [-10, 10]) are correctly handled.  It was introduced since we removed the
offset field in Reader, Trainset, etc.

Some context:

The original reason behind the offset field was to remap ratings in (e.g.) [-5,
5] to ratings in [1, 11], to avoid having 0 ratings. This could cause problems
if we were storing ratings in a sparse matrix: there would be no distinction
between 0 ratings and missing ones.

We currently store ratings as two defaultdict of lists (trainset.ur and
trainset.ir), so 0 ratings should be handled correctly, without needing to
remap them. Maybe it will change in the future, we would have to find a
workaroud.
