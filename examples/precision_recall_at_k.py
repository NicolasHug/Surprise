    Args:
        predictions(list of Prediction objects): The list of predictions, as
            returned by the test method of an algorithm.
        k(int): The number of recommendations on which precision and recall
            will be computed. Default is 10.
        threshold(float): All rating greater than or equal to threshold are
            considered positive. Default is 3.5
    Returns:
    A dict where keys are user (raw) ids and values are tuples
        (precision@k, recall@k).
